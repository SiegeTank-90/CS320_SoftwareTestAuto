# CS320_SoftwareTestAuto

Course Description :: Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.


How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
You canâ€™t be 100% certain, but there are many steps to mitigate bugs and software problems. Security test, validating that any bugs from imported frameworks are closed off, unit testing to validate the code your running and validation inside of it so that it function intentionally, integration testing making sure that your new units work with the existing system. All of these are ways to mitigate problems that can/will occur.  


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Step One, is to ask the user/client determining there needs and listen to there requirements is step one and a vital portion. Step to is seeking out ways to reduce obstacles to their eventual end goal of the product. If your customer asks to be able to sell products and sell them one at a time. Its likely a solid assumption that they will at some point need to sell multiple different products, so building a cart early would be an example of closing those gaps. Design programs with the future products in mine to the best of your ability. 


How do I approach designing software?
My two pillars of focus are usability and scalability, I focus on making the users end goals as simple on their end as possible with the ability to grow the project in the future.
